## Introduction

People have to face a lot of challenges when they want to see a doctor, from having to waste time on the road full of traffic, waiting in long queues for hours to being in hospitals full of patients with contagious diseases. We aim to minimize these problems by introducing a platform where doctors and patients can meet online and a convenient diagnostics device to go with it; eliminating the need to go to a hospital for most of the common medical conditions and get diagnosed in the comfort of your own home.

While there are some solutions already available in the market trying to solve some of these  problems like E-channeling, audio and video conferencing they don't provide a good way for the doctor to monitor the patient's condition easily. We aim to design a cheap yet convenient and effective tool to make everybody's life easier by taking patientâ€™s measurements in real time.

What's available in the system:
    * Making appointments online 
    * Video Consultation.
    * Diagnostics device that reads commonly needed measurements
        -Heartbeat sensing (clear audio with little to no background  noise)
        -Temperature  sensing ( 5&deg;C tolerance)
    * Ability to handle the device via software and hardware
    * Real-Time  measurements.   
    * Getting valid prescriptions from the doctor	    
    * Verified authenticity of the doctor
    * Privacy and Confidentiality
    * Patient history and other analytics
    * User experiences and reviews for a doctor
