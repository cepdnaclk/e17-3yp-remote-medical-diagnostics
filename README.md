### Introduction

People have to face a lot of challenges when they want to see a doctor, from having to waste time on the road full of traffic, waiting in long queues for hours to being in hospitals full of patients with contagious diseases. We aim to minimize these problems by introducing a platform where doctors and patients can meet online and a convenient diagnostics device to go with it; eliminating the need to go to a hospital for most of the common medical conditions and get diagnosed in the comfort of your own home.
